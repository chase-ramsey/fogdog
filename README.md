# Fogdog

Fogdog fetches weather info and looks for indications of fog to alert you via SMS about foggy conditions. If there's no fog, once per day Fogdog will bring you the bad (or good?) news and provide a brief local weather update.

Fogdog is deployed on AWS Lambda and currently only serves the Nashville area.
