# Fogdog

Fogdog fetches weather info and looks for indications of fog to alert you via SMS about foggy conditions. By providing a JSON file mapping zip codes to names of local areas, Fogdog will let you know where there's fog in town. If there's no fog, once per day Fogdog will bring you the bad (or good?) news.
